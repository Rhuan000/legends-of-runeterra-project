# Legends Of Runeterra History Project
This project began with a desire to view my gameplay history, as the in-game interface lacked this feature. My initial research led me to Riot APIs to understand the available data and how to get it. Then I needed to decode the deck details, choosing to implement it in Rust as part of a learning experience inspired by my readings. My primary focus was on extracting match information, such as the opponent's username, cards used in the deck, match type, duration, and outcome. As I progressed, I recognized the need for a more user-friendly display. However, GUI in Rust are not the strong spot of the language, prompting me to opt for a web interface. I implemented this interface using JavaScript with React for improved visual presentation.



## Libs
- Styled-Components


## Working
For now the main focus is finish the front web settings and work in asynchronous request maded to riot api. To reduce the waiting time.
